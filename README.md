# CmpE300-ReliefAlgorithm

In this project, parallel programming is used via MPI library.

Aim of the project is selecting top weighted features using Relief Algorithm. Number of processors and a dataset with features of instances is given as inputs and for each processor top weigthed features are listed at the end of the program.

More details are in the report.
